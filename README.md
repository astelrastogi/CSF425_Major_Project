## Problem Statement:

To create a generative model (either a GAN or a VAE) that would generate an audio clip based on an input parameter that specifies the genre of the audio clip. For testing purposes, we shall be considering samples of the genre ”classical”, as they are the easiest to generate (as they do not have any vocals)
